					<h2>The Broken Egg</h2>
					<img

						alt=""
						class="projectPageImage" />
					<p>
						<strong>Description:</strong> What's for dinner? On 'The Broken
						Egg,' you can browse recipes using a variety of different parameters
						and view ingredients and instructions. From classics to food from
						around the world, there's lots to discover on 'The Broken Egg!'
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Role:</strong> As the sole creator, I implemented React, as
						well as Redux, to help me manipulate state across all of my
						components. I also used TypeScript to help me write more meaningful
						code. TypeScript also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of
						React, Redux, and JavaScript, by forcing me to 'type' all of my
						components, variables, and functions.

					<h2>BetterReads</h2>
					<img

					<p>
						<strong>Description:</strong> Are you an author looking to grow your
						readership? Or are you a reader, searching for your next favorite
						book? Welcome to BetterReads, a site where you can do just that!
					</p>
					<p>
						BetterReads was created to help connect authors and readers
						together. Authors can upload information on their books to the site
						and can post events like book signings or Q&As. Readers can then
						browse those events and attend ones they are interested in. They can
						also browse books in search of their next literary quest!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Role:</strong> I was in charge of the frontend aspects of
						the project. I used Tailwind for the css, Figma for the objects like
						the bookshelf, banners, and the bookmark on the account pages, and
						Google Icons for the icons on the landing and contact pages. I also
						assisted my partner on the backend, creating CRUD routes and helping
						with debugging.

					<h2>Park-a-pedia</h2>
					<img
						src="/images/parkapediaHome.png"
						alt=""
						class="projectPageImage" />

					<p>
						<strong>Description: </strong>Ever wanted to know more about the
						many natural/historical sites across the US? Now you can!
						Park-a-pedia is a place where users can search for a specific park,
						if they know the name, grab a random park, or search by state. Each
						page for an individual park contains information like the phone
						number, address, any alerts for that location, and a description.
						Find your next adventure on Park-a-pedia!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Role: </strong>I was the sole developer for this project. I
						chose the API from the National Park Service and decided how to
						style and render the information from that API on the page. I also
						added in more features, such as the auto-complete on the landing
						page's search bar, based off of feedback from testers.

					<h2>Pokemon Adventure</h2>
					<img

					<p>
						<strong>Description: </strong>Become a Pokemon trainer and go on
						your very own Pokemon Adventure! You can catch Pokemon in various
						locations, find items to keep your journey going, and can even
						encounter Team Rocket!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Role: </strong>This was a solo project at the end of the
						Python module in my bootcamp. I added in the basic game logic
						(catching Pokemon), then added more (locations, Team Rocket) based
						on feedback from testers.
					</p>

					<h2>A little more about me</h2>
					<p>
						I originally got into coding because of my blog -- I wanted to edit
						parts of the theme and make it my own. I was able to do that for a
						couple of things, but for others, I didn't understand where to
						start. So I bought a course on Udemy which was my first formal
						introduction to web development. After my time in Japan came to an
						end, I decided to shift my career to Software Engineering.
